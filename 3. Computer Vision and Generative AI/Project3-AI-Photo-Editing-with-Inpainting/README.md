# AI Photo Editing with Inpainting
In this project we will build a nice web app that allows us to swap out the background of a subject and substitute it with an image generated by Stable Diffusion through a text prompt.

### Dependencies
requirements.txt

### 1. Segment the subject
Demonstrate proficiency in loading and using the `Segment Anything Model (SAM)` to segment objects

### 2. Inpainting
The student demonstrate proficiency in loading a pretrained AutoPipelineForInpainting from the `diffusers` library

### 3. Interactive App
The students use the app, showing they understand how to run SAM to segment the subject and substitute the background or the subject with text prompts

### 4. Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out
#### Study how parameters affect the result
Try the same prompt with different values for the `Classifier-Free Guidance Scale` and record the results.

#### Prompt engineering
Imagine a not-so-simple scene you want to obtain starting from a picture you have. Keeping the random seed fixed, experiment with prompt engineering by iteratively adding or removing elements to the text prompt and record the effects until you get close enough to your original idea

#### Iterative changes
Experiment with modifying an image by passing it through the app multiple times. For example, select the subject, substitute the background, then download the results and upload it again as the input image. Then substitute the subject.
